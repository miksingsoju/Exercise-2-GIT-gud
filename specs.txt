Fraction Specifications
A. Fraction() can be constructed in three ways:
    - Using a pair of integers (numerator, denominator) -> Fraction(5, 1)
    - From another rational number -> Fraction(123)
    - From a string -> Fraction('-3/7')
    - All other inputs should not be accepted
Sample Valid:
    Fraction(5,1)
    Fraction(5)
    Fraction('5/7')
    Fraction('-5/7')
    Fraction('5/-7')
    Fraction('-5/-7')
    Fraction('       -5/7        ')
Sample Invalid:
    Fraction(1.123)
    Fraction(5,0)

    Both parameters should be instances of rational numbers
    Both numerator and denominator can be negative
    Can have leading or trailing whitespaces
    Decimals/ floats are not accepted

B. Method gcd(a,b) that can be called without instantiating the class
    - Return the greatest common divisor of the integers a and b.
    - if either a or b is nonzero, then the absolute value of gcd(a,b) is the largest integer that divides both a and b
    - Observe proper usage of negative values
    - gcd(0, 0) returns 0. If any of the parameters is 0, gcd() returns 0.
C. The user of the Fraction() class has three methods to get the numerator and denominator or the fraction
- get_numerator() returns the numerator as a string
- Format: [sign] 'integer' where sign can only be '-' or empty string -> '1', '-1'
- Value should be in lowest terms -> 10/2 -> numerator = 5
- get_denominator() returns the denominator as a string
- Value should also be in lowest terms -> 10/2 -> denominator = 1
- get_fraction() returns the fraction in lowest terms
- Format: [sign] 'numerator' ['/' denominator]

Examples:
    '1'
    '-3/7'
    '-1000'

D. Others
- Raises ZeroDivisionError if denominator is 0 regardless of how it is constructed
- The class is immutable
